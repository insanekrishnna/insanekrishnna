# 👋 Hey, I'm Pratham Yadav

I'm a *software developer* from 🇮🇳 who loves building things for the web - clean interfaces, smart systems, and experiences that just *feel right.*

Most of my work revolves around **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**.  
I’m always exploring new tools and frameworks that make the web more dynamic, delightful, and a little smarter every time.

### 🧠 What I’m Into
- Building smooth, scalable web apps  
- Experimenting with *AI × Web* - apps that not only look good but *think*  
- Exploring great UX and design systems  
- Constantly learning, tinkering, and shipping side projects

### 🧩 Tech Stack
**Frontend:** Next.js · React · TypeScript · TailwindCSS  
**Backend:** Node.js · Express.js · Firebase · MongoDB  
**Tools:** Git · VS Code · Postman · Figma

### 🎧 Along with Code
When I’m not building or debugging, you’ll probably find me:  
- Walking around quiet places 🌿  
- Watching anime 🎬  
- Listening to music - anything from cinematic scores to Japanese tracks 🎶  

> *build insane ⚡*
